> Question 1: For the following situations, determine which search approach to use and why would you take that approach. Write your answers in the submission box below.

**A.**

1. Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name

A. The best approach for searching a sorted database or list is to use a Binary Search algorithm because its logarithmic searching time complexity makes it a quick and efficient option.

2. Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend

A. Here a linear search approach would be the best one since the list is unsorted. A binary search wouldn not do the job correctly in this situation.

3. Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.

A. Again, whenever we have a sorted list, the best approach is to use a binary search algorithm, which implements a "divide and conquer" phylosophy. 

4. Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints

A. As a binary search algorithm would not be a good fit to search an unsorted list, the best search algorithm to use is an iterative (or linear with a time complexity of O(n)) one.
